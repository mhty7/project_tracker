# project_tracker
a Web-based database system with its own user-friendly GUI - for easy-use by any organization’s managers and staff.


Track Project is meant to provide organizations a useful tool by which: (1) they can dynamically track their activities and its corresponding beneficiaries, and at the same time: (2) maintain an active database that provides a historical view of their project’s statistical performance over a monthly and yearly basis. 
Track Project is developed through Django and PostGreSQL. We find these two softwares as being capable of providing the necessary mechanisms for our system’s needs.
Track Project is web-based, as this feature more easily allows our target organizations the capability to update the database in real-time.


PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT
Track Project has been designed to address the needs of growing organizations (particularly Non-Governmental Organizations or NGOs) to maintain active database systems that allow them to track their projects and beneficiaries.
In the case of NGOs, many new policies from government-rating agencies (such as PCNC) specifically require NGOs to come up with efficient systems by which they can track and monitor their activities and beneficiaries. This in fact forms a key aspect by which PCNC evaluates the soundness of an NGO.
Many of those working in organizations however (particularly NGOs) are not technically-literate enough to handle low-level queries or maintenance in traditional database systems such as SQL.
Thus, in an effort to help organizations in this need, we have developed an extremely user-friendly web-based tool that will allow an organization’s managers and staff to easily input and track their projects and beneficiaries in a dynamic manner (irrespective of their level of computer-literacy).
